              Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases, with an
              extractable EVM implementation. It can also be run on test networks such as Sepolia and Görli. Hyperledger Besu includes several consensus
              algorithms including Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, and Proof of Authority (IBFT 2.0, QBFT, and Clique). Its comprehensive permissioning schemes
              are designed specifically for use in a consortium environment.

              Hyperledger Sawtooth offers a flexible and modular architecture separates the core system from the application domain, so smart contracts can
              specify the business rules for applications without needing to know the underlying design of the core system. Hyperledger Sawtooth supports a
              variety of consensus algorithms, including Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET).
